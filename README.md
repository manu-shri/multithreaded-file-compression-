OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
PROJECT: Multithreaded file compression tool
Multithreading:The file is divided into 2 chunks, each processed in parallel by a separate thread to speed up compression and decompression.
Compression and Decompression:It uses the zlib library to perform simple compression (compress()) and decompression (uncompress()).
Basic Flow:Read the file into memory, split into chunks, compress or decompress each chunk in parallel, then write the resulting data back to a file.
